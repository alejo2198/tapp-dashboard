## üöß Improvements

### 1. Modularity
- Refactor large components into smaller, reusable ones to reduce file size and improve readability.
- Separate UI concerns from business logic to enhance maintainability.

### 2. Tailwind Configuration
- Customize the Tailwind config (`tailwind.config.js`) to:
  - Add reusable color tokens (e.g., `primary`, `accent`, `background`). I had them inserte,d but I ran into a bug that made me call the CSS variable and not the configured color


### 3. Error Handling
- Add error states for:
  - Empty fetch responses (e.g., no users found)
  - Failed API calls (e.g., network or server errors)
- Display fallback UI or retry options.
- Would be nice to have a notification or toast system for errors/success feedback.

### 4. Add User Logic
- Create a function to handle valid address input:
  - Extract `street`, `zip`, `city`, and `geo` coordinates (latitude & longitude)
  - Integrate with a geocoding service like Google Maps API or OpenStreetMap (Nominatim).
  - Use extracted values to populate user records.
 
### 5. Utilize a Google Maps API
- Utilize this API:
   - to create a map in the user details page
   - to retrieve zip/postal/city/coord data from an address
 
### 6. Links / Phone
 - Change all the phone, email, and website links to built-in next Link tags that email or call that person
 - Some phones had extensions would be best to take the string with or without an extension and separate it with a utils function. Then save the phone number as an object with number types for phone and an optional extension
  - Update the form to accept extensions for phones

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements & Best Practices

- [x] Use **Next.js App Router**
- [x] Use **Server Components** where appropriate
- [x] Use **Client Components** for interactive features
- [x] Apply **basic styling** (TailwindCSS recommended)
- [x] Maintain **clean and scalable folder structure**
- [x] Use **async/await** properly
- [ ] Handle **errors** gracefully
- [x] Add **TypeScript types** if TypeScript is used
